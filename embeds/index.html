    <h1>How to Create High-Quality Embeds (Not GIFs) (With Sound on Mobile)</h1>

    <p>Welcome back to another tutorial, a rather simple one.</p>
    <p>I am going to show you how to embed videos in various places like Discord.<br>
	<br>
    <strong>For this I will mainly focus on what happens in Discord.</strong><br>
    The videos will show up as embeds that can be favorited, but they are not GIFs.</p>

    <h2>1. Find your video</h2>
    <p>Choose the video you want to make an embed.</p>

    <h2>2. Get into an Imgur account</h2>
    <p>Head over to <a href="https://imgur.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://imgur.com/</a> and either create or log into an account.</p>

    <h2>3. Post the video on Imgur</h2>
    <p>The max length is 3 minutes. Keep the audio while posting.</p>

    <h2>4. Copy its link</h2>
    <p>Imgur will provide a link. Copy it.</p>

    <h2>5. Send the link</h2>
    <p>If the site/app supports it, the video will embed. On Discord, it will show as a high-quality embed that you can add to favorites.</p>
